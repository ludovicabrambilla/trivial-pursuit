# Trivia quiz game

Trivia like Python quiz game (2 to 6 players) built for Codecademy "Computer Science - Career Path".
The project is an application of the concepts learnt through the first module of the course, which covers basic elements of Python, from the introduction to programming to the first elements of OOP.

## Disclaimer: this is a learning project!
This project does not have any distribution purposes. It is just a learning project, created to practice concepts learnt through the First module of [Codecademy's Computer Science Career Path](https://join.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science/).

The Module covers the basics of Programming in Python, such as:
- variables
- functions
- data types
- modules and pip
- Object Oriented Programming (classes and methods)

The course also gives an overview of some tools the programmer might need in the development process, such as:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
To further learn about these tools, I took [Codecademy's course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) on the topic.

Based on these premises, the project may evolve according to the new competences I progressively acquire in my software development journey.
